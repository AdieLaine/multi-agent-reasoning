## Swarm Integration

### Overview

**Swarm Integration** enhances the Multi-Agent Reasoning system by enabling dynamic agent coordination and task delegation. Swarm allows agents to collaborate efficiently, leveraging collective intelligence to solve complex tasks and improve responsiveness.

Swarm focuses on making agent coordination and execution lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable. It achieves this through two primitive abstractions: **Agents** and **Handoffs**. An Agent encompasses instructions and tools and can, at any point, choose to hand off a conversation to another Agent.

![Swarm Integration](img/swarm.png)
### How It Works

- **Swarm Client Initialization**

  ```python
  from swarm import Agent, Swarm
  client = Swarm()
  ```

- **Agent Initialization**
  - Agents are initialized using Swarm, incorporating configurations from `agents.json`.
  - Each agent has unique instructions and is aware of other agents' capabilities.

- **Conversation Handling**
  - Swarm manages conversation flow, agent selection, and function execution.
  - Agents can delegate tasks to specialized agents based on context.

### Swarm-Based Reasoning

**Objective**: Utilize the **Swarm Framework for Intelligence** to coordinate agents dynamically for efficient collaboration and task delegation.

**Steps**:

1. **Initialization**
   - Load agents from `agents.json`.
   - Initialize agents with awareness of their counterparts.

2. **Discussion**
   - Each agent provides an initial response to the user prompt.
   - Responses are collected and displayed with agent-specific colors.

3. **Verification**
   - Agents verify their own responses for accuracy.

4. **Critiquing**
   - Agents critique each other's verified responses.

5. **Refinement**
   - Agents refine their responses based on critiques.

6. **Blending Responses**
   - Swarm coordinates the blending of refined responses into a final answer.

*Example*:

- **User Prompt**: "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on society."
- **Swarm Agents**:
  - **Agent 47**: Discusses logical implications and ethical considerations.
  - **Agent 74**: Explores creative advancements and future possibilities.
- **Swarm Coordination**:
  - Agents verify, critique, and refine responses.
  - Blending results in a comprehensive answer covering various aspects of AI's societal impact.

### Swarm Chat Interface

**Objective**: Provide a seamless chat interface leveraging Swarm's capabilities for agent interactions.

- **Swarm Agent for Chat**
  - Manages the conversation, utilizing other agents as needed.

  ```python
  def swarm_chat_interface(conversation_history):
      # Load Swarm agent's configuration
      swarm_agent = ...  # Initialize Swarm agent
      messages = [{"role": "system", "content": swarm_agent.instructions}]
      messages.extend(conversation_history)
      response = client.run(agent=swarm_agent, messages=messages)
      swarm_reply = response.messages[-1]['content'].strip()
      return swarm_reply
  ```

- **Dynamic Responses**
  - Swarm agent delegates tasks to specialized agents ensuring relevant handling.

*Example*:

- **User**: "I need help resetting my password."
- **Swarm Agent**: Delegates to a specialized support agent.
- **Support Agent**: Provides step-by-step password reset instructions.
- **Swarm Agent**: Ensures seamless conversation flow.

### Best Practices

- **Agent Design**
  - Define clear instructions and unique capabilities for each agent.
  - Avoid role redundancy by assigning distinct expertise areas.

- **Function Definitions**
  - Utilize functions for task-specific operations or agent handoffs.
  - Ensure functions return meaningful results or appropriate agents.

- **Context Variables**
  - Share information between agents using context variables.
  - Maintain conversation flow and user-specific data.

- **Error Handling**
  - Implement robust error handling within functions and interactions.
  - Ensure graceful recovery from exceptions.

- **Testing**
  - Test individual agents and their collaborations.
  - Use Swarm's REPL or logging for monitoring interactions and performance.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- **What is Swarm, and how does it enhance the system?**
  - Swarm is a framework for lightweight, scalable agent coordination and execution. It facilitates dynamic agent handoffs and function executions, improving system responsiveness and flexibility.

- **Do I need to modify my existing agents to work with Swarm?**
  - Agents should be defined as Swarm `Agent` instances. Existing agents can be adapted by incorporating Swarm's structure and conventions.

- **Can I add more agents to the Swarm system?**
  - Yes. Define additional agents in the `agents.json` file and initialize them within the system.

- **How does Swarm handle agent handoffs?**
  - Agents can define functions that return other agents. Swarm manages these handoffs seamlessly, passing control to the new agent.

- **Is Swarm compatible with the models used in the system?**
  - Yes. Swarm can utilize any appropriate model as configured, defaulting to `gpt-4o`.

## Local JSON Memory Logic

### Context Retention and Retrieval

**Local Memory via JSON** supports storing user-and-assistant interactions in a JSON-based memory. When a user submits a new prompt, the system performs a naive keyword search among recent records to find potentially relevant contexts, which are prepended to the prompt.

![Local Memory via JSON](img/neural.png)
### How It Works

#### JSON Storage

All user prompts and final responses are appended to one of two JSON files:

- `reasoning_history.json` for multi-agent logic sessions
- `swarm_reasoning_history.json` for swarm-based sessions

#### Simple Keyword Matching

Upon each new prompt, the system extracts simple keywords and scans the JSON logs. If matches are found, it builds a context string from up to `max_records` relevant entries.

#### Prompt Incorporation

The retrieved context is appended to the new prompt, providing local memory to inform agent responses.

#### Context Retention or Reset

After each response, the user can choose to retain context for future queries or reset the conversation memory.

### Future Expansion: Embeddings

Enhance memory retrieval with semantic embeddings (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) and a vector store (FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant, etc.) for more robust matching, even if the user query doesn’t contain exact keywords. To implement:

1. Generate embeddings for each chunk of stored history.
2. Store them in a vector database.
3. Perform approximate nearest-neighbor searches instead of naive keyword matching.
4. Optionally combine both naive and semantic searches for comprehensive coverage.

## Prompt Caching

### Overview

**Prompt Caching** optimizes the Multi-Agent Reasoning system by reducing latency and costs associated with repeated or lengthy prompts. It caches the longest common prefixes of prompts, enabling faster processing for subsequent requests that reuse these prefixes.

![Prompt Caching](img/promptcache.png)

### How It Works

- **Automatic Caching**: Prompts exceeding 1,024 tokens are candidates for caching.
- **Cache Lookup**: Checks if the initial portion of a prompt is already cached.
  - **Cache Hit**: Utilizes cached prefix, reducing processing time and resources.
  - **Cache Miss**: Processes the full prompt and caches its prefix for future use.
- **Cache Duration**:
  - Active for 5 to 10 minutes of inactivity.
  - May persist up to one hour during off-peak times.

### Monitoring Cache Usage

- **Usage Metrics**:
  - API responses include a `usage` field with token details.
  - Example:
    ```json
    "usage": {
      "prompt_tokens": 2006,
      "completion_tokens": 300,
      "total_tokens": 2306,
      "prompt_tokens_details": {
        "cached_tokens": 1920
      },
      "completion_tokens_details": {
        "reasoning_tokens": 0
      }
    }
    ```
  - `cached_tokens`: Tokens retrieved from cache.
- **Token Usage Transparency**:
  - Displays token usage after responses, aiding in monitoring cache effectiveness and costs.

### Best Practices

- **Structure Prompts Effectively**:
  - Place static or frequently reused content at the beginning.
  - Position dynamic content towards the end.
- **Maintain Consistency**:
  - Use consistent prompt prefixes to maximize cache hits.
  - Ensure identical prompts where caching is desired.
- **Monitor Performance**:
  - Track cache hit rates and latency to refine caching strategies.
- **Usage Patterns**:
  - Frequent use of the same prompts keeps them in cache longer.
  - Off-peak hours may offer longer cache retention.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- **Does Prompt Caching Affect the API's Final Response?**
  - No. Caching impacts prompt processing, not the completion generation. Outputs remain consistent.

- **How Is Data Privacy Maintained?**
  - Caches are organization-specific. Only members within the same organization can access cached prompts.

- **Is Manual Cache Management Available?**
  - Currently, manual cache clearing is unavailable. Cached prompts are automatically evicted after periods of inactivity.

- **Are There Additional Costs for Using Prompt Caching?**
  - No additional charges. Prompt Caching is enabled automatically.

- **Does Prompt Caching Impact Rate Limits?**
  - Yes, cached prompt requests still count towards rate limits.

- **Compatibility with Zero Data Retention Requests?**
  - Yes, Prompt Caching aligns with Zero Data Retention policies.

### Customization

- **Adding Agents**: Define new agents by adding entries to the `agents` array.
- **Modifying Attributes**: Adjust attributes like `system_purpose`, `interaction_style`, and `personality` to tailor agent behaviors and interactions.
- **Agent Awareness**: Agents are aware of each other based on the configurations provided, enabling collaborative interactions.

*Example*:

- **User**: "Do you work with another agent?"
- **Agent 47**: "Yes, I collaborate with Agent 74 and the Swarm Agent. Together, we provide comprehensive insights."

## Code Structure and Logic

The project is structured to facilitate both reasoning processes and chat interactions with agents, integrating the **Swarm Framework** for enhanced coordination.

### Key Components

1. **Imports and Initialization**
   - **Libraries**: `os`, `time`, `logging`, `json`, `re`, `concurrent.futures`, `colorama`, `tiktoken`, `openai`, `swarm_middle_agent`.
   - **Initialization**:
     - Colorama for console colors.
     - Logging with custom colored formatter.
     - Swarm client initialization.

2. **Agent Initialization**
   - **Loading Configurations**: Parses `agents.json` to initialize agents.
   - **Agent Awareness**: Agents are informed about other agents' configurations and capabilities.

3. **Swarm Integration**
   - **Swarm Chat Interface**: Manages chat interactions using the Swarm agent.
   - **Swarm-Based Reasoning**: Coordinates multi-step reasoning involving multiple agents.

4. **Reasoning Logic**
   - **Multi-Step Process**: Discussion, Verification, Critique, Refinement, Blending, Feedback Loop, and Context Retention.
   - **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent agent actions.

5. **Prompt Caching**
   - **Mechanism**: Caches prompt prefixes to optimize processing of repeated prompts.
   - **Monitoring**: Displays token usage details for transparency.

6. **Utility Functions**
   - **Logging**: Custom colored log messages based on severity and keywords.
   - **Session Management**: Saving and retrieving reasoning history.
   - **Console Utilities**: Formatted headers and dividers for improved readability.

### Error Handling

- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implements retries with exponential backoff for API calls.
- **Logging**: Errors and significant events are logged for debugging and monitoring.

### Parallel Processing

- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Enables concurrent execution of agent tasks, enhancing efficiency.
